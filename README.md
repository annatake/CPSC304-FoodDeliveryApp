# Food Delivery Database UI

This is an application that allows the user to view, insert, delete, update tables, as well as run some queries to find some cool information about customers who use our \~imaginary\~ Food Delivery App! The purpose of this app is to help the user gain insight on which customer generates the most revenue for the business.

# How to get started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open a terminal window and setup an SSH tunnel with port forwarding to the UBC server (the Java connection handler expects this to be set up before running the application)
3. Open the project in IntelliJ (or any other IDE) and click 'Run'
4. Enter your JDBC Oracle login credentials
5. Have fun with the app!
